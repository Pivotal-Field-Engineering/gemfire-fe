# Gemfire Docs, Utility Components, and Examples
This repo contains useful stuff that go beyond the official Gemfire documentation and samples.  Included:
* **docs**.  An overview of Gemfire that is somewhere between the marketing materials and full blown training.  Also included is a document that describes advanced Gemfire techniques and strategies.
* **gemfire-utils**.  Utility components that can be simply built and used.
* **gemfire-examples**.  Complete, functioning advanced examples of Gemfire.
* **metrics**.  Not specific to Gemfire, but useful nonetheless.  This is a framework for capturing and distributing metrics, such as timings and rates.
* **jcollectd**.  A patched version of jcollectd, a Java port of collectd.  Used by the metrics framework.
